                    <p>1892. While Coca-Cola was invented and first sold in 1888, the secret formula and brand was bought in 1889 by Asa Griggs Candler, who incorporated The Coca-Cola Company three years later. On 5 September, 1919, a consortium of businessmen led by Ernest Woodruff, Robert W. Woodruff's father, purchased The Coca-Cola Company for $25 million and it went on the New York stock market.</p>
